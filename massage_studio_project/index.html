                                <p>Classic massage involves directly massaging the skin and muscles in the affected area. Five different hand movements are used –stroking, kneading, rubbing, tapping and vibrating. The basic idea behind this approach is that pain is often caused by tense and tight muscles that affect blood circulation and irritate the nerves. The aim of classic massage is to relax the muscles and improve circulation by directly treating these problems.</p>

                            <p>A pregnancy massage - also known as a prenatal massage - is a massage or hand-on treatment done during pregnancy. There are different types of massages and are similar to regular massages but are more concentrated on the well-being of the mother and child. They typically last an hour and can be adapted to each individual depending on the mother's needs. You usually lie on your side but massage therapists can also use a massage table to increase comfort.

                                It is generally safe to do after the first trimester as long as you inform your doctor and massage therapist of your pregnancy. Some therapists are careful with pressure points and use a range of massage techniques to avoid discomfort and pain.</p>
