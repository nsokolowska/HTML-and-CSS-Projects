<p><i> &#34 I am good, but not an angel.
<br>I do sin, but I am not the devil.
<br>I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.&#34 </i>

<h2>#3</h2>
<p<i>&#34 Monsters are real,
<br> and ghosts are real too. 
<br>They live inside us, and sometimes, they win.&#34 </i>

<h2>#4</h2>
<p><i>&#34 The most important things are the hardest things to say. 
<br>They are the things you get ashamed of 
<br>because words diminish your feelings 
<br>- words shrink things that seem timeless
<br>when they are in your head to no more 
<br>than living size when they are brought out.&#34 </i>
